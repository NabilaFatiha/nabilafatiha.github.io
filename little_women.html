		      <p>During my day-off or free time, things that are favour to be done by me including reading
                     and exploring new film. Usually, my go to genre would be biography, drama and family. The whole family
                     share the same interest as mine, there would be time when my brothers recommended certain film. Those memorable
                     moment when the whole family laughing while watching Mrs. Doubtfire and Disney's animation film. The other one that
                     positively impact me is The Big Year starring by Jack Black and Owen Wilson. Since, the story taught me to keep
                     trying even your path getting darker and to always be there for our family. It's something I constantly remind myself,
                     due to my daily schedule packed with university tasks. I'm going to start focusing on my current favourite film
                     which known as Little Women. The plot and characters development relatable with the situation currently faced
                     by the girls right now. Out there, still tons of individuals being sceptical with the roles of women. Several
                     countries highly deployed females as a worker in brothel. The fact any female should have the rights to grow from
                     the aspect of education, spiritually or emotionally. As a Muslim, our beloved Prophet Muhammad S.A.W taught his
                     followers the same moral and it clearly shown through his wonderful behaviours. In the film, I did found certain life lesson
                     that are worth to be learn whether for men or women.</p>
                       <p>Little Women focuses on a family of six which consists of a husband and a wife living together with four lovely daughters.
                      Even though they were siblings, each of their personality shined differently. Personally, my thought always goes to Jo March
                      as the most impeccable characters. That does not meant to say she free from any flaws. Jo frequently voice her concern about
                      having quick-temper behaviours. Other than that, she is smart and goal-oriented type individual. Compared to other March sisters,
                      her personality leaning towards boyish and tough. When any sisters get into trouble or a guy tried to hit on them, she's
                      the first to come and stay by their side. The most tragic moment in the film is when Beth March, her younger sister 
                      died due to scarlet fever. During the whole journey of Beth fighting with the sickness, Jo stays with her and being a sister
                      full of affection. The other trait that I truly adore is her spirit in writing. Her biggest wish is to write and
                      publish a novel. She finished and ready to present few of her self written work to a potential publisher, unfortunately,
                      it was been rejected. The most frequent reason voiced by them is how the female characters not end up with 
                      a charming hero. Since, book with that kind of plot is the most profitable. Jo always stand strong with her
                      thought that a lady does not have the need to find a guy for the sake of happiness. She believed women are equally
                      independent and have the right to achieve their life goals. I did experienced few moments when people completely
                      against my thought and refused to hear a single word. Rather than be salty about that, it is better to focus
                      on anything else that worth my attention. Keep looking straight and think all the bad memory happened to make you
                      stronger than before. How Jo March presenting herself inspired me to work harder and never stop growing.
                        <p>In the film, there are scene shown the sisters fighting due to intense rivalry. At the end, all the fault was
                      forgotten and stand stronger as a family. A lesson that I would like to share is living your life with simplicity 
                      is not always meaningless. It taught all of us, we don't really need to be surrounded by luxury in order to be 
                      happy. Sometimes, it only takes the feeling of gratefulness by appreciating what you have. It could
                      be a loving family, a home sweet home or a good company of friends.</p>
