		      <p>Firstly, a big welcome to those who takes time in reading the content of my website.
              It might be far from perfect, the fact I'm still a beginner and continuously learning.
			  These website definitely meaningful for me, since it's my first time to try and developed one.
			  Before proceeding, my name is Nabila Fatiha binti Rosly, was bornt in Pahang and raise in Selangor. 
			  My family moved out lots of time due to dad's job requirement. I've had stayed in Kelantan for a year
			  and it is interesting moment for me. Currently, still studying in Universiti Institut Teknologi Mara 
			  majoring in Diploma of Information Management and thinking to pursue a degree after these. Being
			  a student in these field taught me lots of different things, especially with anything regarding
			  information and technologies handling. I've still have the needs to improve my skills
			  in certain aspect.</p>

			   <h5>Ultimate bucket list</h5>
			    <div class="image-holder"><img src="New folder/adventure.jpg" class="fake-img"
			 style="height:300px;"></div>
			    <p>When talking about dream job, yes I did have a few in mind. It is great to be ambitious and thinking the opportunity
				you'll meet in the future. As a reminder, wishing and hoping not enough in acting as a medium to achieve what you have
				been waiting for. Every dream should align with prayers and efforts. It is essential to constantly remind ourselves
				to be a hand to those in needs. Especially, the world currently battling with a tragic moment due to the pandemic. Some
				of them lost their loved ones or struggling to survive. We might wish our day could be better, but believe me there are
				few out there wishing to have your life. No matter what, be grateful and thankful to what we have. Talking about bucket list, 
				it's a thing involved listing your most favourable wish. I did have one, which included going on a road trip at a foreign
				country. My first choice definitely Morocco, Iceland and New Zealand. People opinion about road trip are differ, since some 
				of them thought it's a joyous activity and others think oppositely. Personally, to me, the journey undoubtedly must be tiring
				since you were constantly on the road. Just thinking all the wonderful moments awaiting during the upcoming time surely
				undescribable with words. Having a bucket list obliging in helping us to stay motivated to ensure we able to achieve a 
				meaningful life and to not easily giving up. A documentary I've watched before which focuses on a cancer patient that have strong will
				to travel the world. At the same time, it gave him a piece of hope to continuously battling with the cancer. Most importantly,
				he did have a chance to fulfill the bucket list. Not to forget, individuals tend to misinterpret the concept of positivity. Staying
				positive does not meant to be happy always even during the toughest moment. Instead, it taught all of us to be patient and believe
				good day definitely come.</p>
